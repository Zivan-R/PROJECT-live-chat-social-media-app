********************************************* BASICS *********************************************

1. Install Git

    Download and install Git
    During installation, choose the default options unless you have specific preferences.

2. Configure Git

    Open Git Bash and run these commands to set your username and email (these will be tied to your commits):

        bash

        git config --global user.name "Your Name"
        git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
    
    PS: Best to use Github's noreply email

3. Create a GitHub Account

    Go to GitHub and sign up for an account if you don't have one.
    Confirm your email.

4. Generate an SSH Key

    Generate an SSH key to securely connect to GitHub without needing to enter your password every time.

        bash

        ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"

            Press Enter to save the key to the default location.
            Press Enter twice to skip the passphrase (or set one if you want more security).

5. Add SSH Key to GitHub

    Copy your public SSH key to the clipboard:

        bash

        cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

    Go to GitHub's SSH and GPG keys settings.
    Click New SSH key, paste the key, and give it a title.

6. Test the SSH Connection

    Test if the SSH key works:

        bash

        ssh -T git@github.com

    You should see a message like:

        bash

        Hi username! You've successfully authenticated...

7. Create a New Project Folder

    In Git Bash, navigate to where you want to create the project folder and run:

        bash

        mkdir my-project
        cd my-project

8. Initialize Git in the Project Folder

    bash

    git init

9. Create a Repository on GitHub

    Go to GitHub and click New.
    Create a new repository (leave it empty without a README for now).

10. Connect Local Repo to GitHub Repo

    Get the GitHub repository URL (SSH URL) and connect it:

        bash

        git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo-name.git

7-8-9-10 Bis. Do it backwards with github
    
    Create a new repo in Github, copy repo URL
    Clone project locally
        bash

        git clone repoUrl
        cd clonedFolder

11. Create Files & Commit

    Create files or add your project. Then, stage, commit, and push:

        bash

        git add .
        git commit -m "Initial commit"

12. Push to GitHub

    bash

    git push -u origin master

    /!\ Can be master or main! how to check:
    bash

    git branch

    To rename if you want:
        bash

        git branch -M master

You're all set! ðŸŽ‰ Your project should now be on GitHub.

********************************************* WORKFLOW *********************************************

**1. Create Branches

    - Clone the Repository (if you haven't already):

        bash

        git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repo-name.git
        cd your-repo-name

    - Create and Switch to Front-End Branch:

        bash

        git checkout -b frontend

    - Create and Switch to Back-End Branch:

        bash

        git checkout -b backend

    - Push the Branches to GitHub:

        bash

        git push -u origin frontend
        git push -u origin backend

**2. Work on Your Branches

    - Switch to the Appropriate Branch for Work:
        For front-end:

            bash

            git switch frontend (or git checkout frontend)

        For back-end:

            bash

            git switch backend (or git checkout backend)

    - Make Changes and Commit:

        bash

        git add <folder-you-work-in>
        git commit -m "Description of changes"

    - Push Changes to GitHub:

        bash

        git push origin <branch-name>
    
    - Update a specific folder without affecting your local copy of the other folders
    SCENARIO: backend team merged first into main, frontend team wants to pull backend team's work without losing their local copy

        bash

        git switch frontend -> goes into frontend branch
        git fetch origin main -> retreive latest commits from Github's main branch
        git checkout origin/main -- backend/ -> Updates only the backend/ directory from origin/main branch into the current branch (frontend)
    
    - Save untracked files temporarly

        bash

        git stash push -u -> Saves current state of folder temporarly (including untracked files)
        git switch <other-branch>
        *Work on branch, commit and push changes*
        git switch <my-branch>
        git stash pop -> Retrieve stashed changes

    - Remove from repo history:
        bash

        git rm --cached <thing-to-remove>
        git commit -m "Remove thing-to-remove from version control"

        ** IF ADDED TO .gitignore and gets fatal: pathspec 'thing-to-remove' did not match any files (folder)**
        git ls-files | grep thing-to-remove
        git rm -r --cached $(git ls-files | grep thing-to-remove)
        git commit -m "Remove thing-to-remove from version control"
        git push origin <branch name>


**3. Create and Manage Pull Requests (PRs)

    - Go to GitHub Repository:
        - Navigate to your repository on GitHub.

    - Create a Pull Request:
        - Go to the "Pull Requests" tab.
        - Click "New pull request".
        - Choose the base branch (usually main or master) and compare it with your feature branch (e.g., frontend or backend).

    - Review and Merge:
        - Add a title and description for your pull request.
        - Assign reviewers (team members who will review the code).
        - Click "Create pull request".
        - Once approved, merge the pull request:
            - Click "Merge pull request".
            - Confirm the merge.

    - Pull the Latest Changes:
        - After merging, ensure your local branches are up-to-date:

            bash

            git checkout main  # or master
            git pull

**4. Handling Conflicts

    - If there are conflicts, GitHub will notify you when you attempt to merge.
        - Resolve conflicts locally:

            bash

            git checkout frontend  # or backend
            git pull origin main  # or master

        - Resolve any conflicts in your files.
        - Add and commit the resolved files:

            bash

            git add .
            git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"

        - Push the resolved branch:

            bash

            git push

Summary:

    Create branches: frontend and backend.
    Work on branches: Commit and push changes regularly.
    Create pull requests: Review and merge them into the main branch.
    Handle conflicts: Resolve any merge conflicts that arise.

This setup helps manage simultaneous work effectively and ensures smooth integration of changes.
